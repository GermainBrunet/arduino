# Arduino as a Sensor and Control Platform

This is a simple project that uses the "Arduino Nano" as a sensor and control platform.  By combining multiple sensors together one can gather data over time on ambient temperature, water or ground temperature, relative temperature, humidity, pressure, light (lumens).  With this information, it is possible to control different devices (heater, fans, lights) and optimize the environment for an optimum growth.

Due to the lack of inexpensive options, this project looks to provide as much capabilities while minimizing costs.
